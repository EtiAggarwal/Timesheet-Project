From David: 
There has got to be a more user friendly way of correcting or undoing what she has done from DMO and not through PostgreSQL. Why couldn’t we just make the search or field that matters a changeable field instead of a locked file name/number. Users like Bobbie will always have issues with scanning or ordering and it has to be easier. Right not this is too cumbersome for her to get these deeds right in DMO. This causes Kay more time when searching and finding the correct deed and so on….there just has to be a better way of how we are doing it.",9/28/15 10:47,DREAMaps Online,"Sept15 Sprint 1, Sept15 Sprint 2, Oct15 Sprint 1",,9

Things to consider:

The increase in the exploitation of security vulnerabilities in internet applications over the years has required us to especially increase security requirements for internet applications. To meet NDOT’s standards for internet applications, the following must be incorporated into the new Occupancy Permit Status application: 

- The application must be written in a 3- tier architecture with the business logic in the application tier, a middle tier containing services to call the database and pass information back to the application tier, and a database tier to process the database requests. These three tiers all reside on separate servers. 
- The input fields need to be validated within the application to confirm that only valid entries will be accepted and passed on to the middle tier. 
- The SQL queries need to be formatted into stored procedures and saved within the database. 
- A security certificate needs to be employed between the application tier and middle tier for identity and to encrypt communication between the two tiers. 
- The application must cleanly pass security analysis software testing. We use the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) for penetration testing to find vulnerabilities in web applications.

Bug - Internal Reported,Functionality Incomplete,IRWIN-119,Same Business with different addresses,Closed,Unassigned,8/18/11 12:26,"
Yes, the business name has to be unique in the table. Changing that 
architecture is not wise because it will have cascading effects. 
Moreover, if a business with two addresses was entered into the system, 
then how will the user know which business site they are interested in? 

I recommend the following approach to solve these situations: 

Add the street address to business name when the are two addresses for 
the same business. For example: 

Smart Data Strategies [357 Riverside Drive] 
Smart Data Strategies [200 West End Rd.] 

This way we will get two different addresses for the same business name. 
The user will see the business name as listed above with address (or 
whatever you put) within the brackets, so they will know which one to 
pick. When we generate forms and legal material, the software will 
strip out the brackets and its contents and simply print the business 
name (Smart Data Strategies), with the appropriate address.

First I tried doing both NHP and Elko Co Sheriff and got ""System has 
encountered an error. Please exit the application and try again."" I 
logged out and went completely off-line, then started over with the same 
result. Next I tried just adding NHP, and that worked fine. But when I 
tried to go back and add the Sheriff I got the error message again.

Hi Margaret, 

Sorry to bug you with this but I cannot find permit 113456 in the IRWIN system. It was there before and now it is gone. It was on my dashboard in the ""Application is Approved and Issued - Waiting on Work Notification"" and I was looking for the physical file so I could update it in the system if it had a work notification and now it is gone. I asked Michon and she can't find it either. We've tried the search option with the first name, last name, permit number (113456 - Wesley Isefuku),and it does not come up, it does exist, it is just not in IRWIN. It is not a super rush or anything just if you could look into it when you have a chance. I have no idea what happened. 

Thanks for your help,

Subject: Performance measure report 
Importance: High 

I've attached the report that I compiled for the first quarter of FY 
2011. I'm a bit surprised by the numbers but then again the Districts 
were concentrating on getting the permits processed and not fully 
utilizing the new system. I pulled a list of all permits that were 
accepted beginning July 1 and ending on September 30th. I verified 
issue dates and if any ran over the 45 working days I looked to see if 
they had required additional information which of course adds days to 
the review. The numbers are fairly consistent with what we've shown in 
the past. 

In developing this report by hand, one change that I would propose to 
improve the accuracy of the report, would be to do the following; 

1) Provide the information for the current quarter as attached. 

2) For the second quarter, provide this same report but also 
include a report that combines the first and second quarters. This 
improves the accuracy because now we're looking at the permits that were 
accepted near the end of the first quarter but not yet issued. 

3) The third quarter report would again provide the information for 
the quarter but also include a report that shows the first three 
quarters combined and then of course do the same for the final quarter 
of the year. 

For the most part the information in IRWIN was accurate, the problems 
occurred when the coordinators hadn't updated to reflect that there was 
additional information required from the permittee. There were also a 
handful of permits that had been issued (I verified issuance by viewing 
the scanned permit in AX/5) but the step necessary to show it as issued 
in the IRWIN system was never completed. I would imagine once these few 
are cleaned up and they get better at utilizing the system this will 
become a non issue. 

Margaret and I should be able to develop the report so that it can be 
run automatically through IRWIN for the next quarter. Please let me 
know if you agree that the report should reflect the running total for 
the year as suggested and let me know if you have any questions.

On the Billboard module of the AX piece: Is it the same as the Permit on IRWIN side, the thing different on the AX side is the separate application ""ROW_BILLBOARD"", the connector field is the Permit#(field2) instead of the system ID(field1) like the Permit Module, 

Can we talk about this tomorrow.

Subject: Amendments Final Inspection 

Hi Margaret - It looks like when an amendment is pushed to the stage 
""Final Inspection"" it goes to the Permit Coordinator dashboard and not 
the inspector's dashboard. I'm not sure if this is a glitch or a onetime 
error with this amendment. See the attached screen shots for more info. 

Thanks,

it will update all applications with the same applicant id. This is not 
good if a transfer of ownership is done.

Subject: RE: Emailing: SDSDocumentumInterface.vb 

Well, I think the problem has to do with this section of their code: 

With objPageUpload 
.Action = AXTypes.PageUploadAction.InsertAfter 
.Position = _doc.Pages 
.FilePath = _createdata.FilePath 
.FileType = _createdata.FileType 
End With 


They do not ever define the .FileType that I can see. For example, if you are uploading an image file, they should do something like this: 

With CreationData 
.AppID = _AxAppID 
.DataSourceName = _AxDatasource 
.AppName = _AxAppName 
.FileType = AXTypes.FileType.FT_IMAGE 
.FilePath = strFilename 
.SubpgCount = 0 
.IgnoreDLS = True 
.IgnoreDupIndex = True 
End With 

They should be able to do a select statement from the file extension that they grab. 

Thanks,

BillboardSession.Applicant_ID is passed as a parameter when saving the sign owner information.

the database and add the Approved Issued Permit # aka: PERMIT_NO to

Now for what caused the issue. I will have to look at Dashboard Status 
""Application in Review - Documents for Release Received"" and see if the 
permit_no is getting populated at this stage. What I think is happening 
is that when the district engineer signs off on the terms and conditions 
it is not setting the permit_no.

I don't know what happened; the problem is in the program. It 
still shows as assigned to you in IRWIN and should be statused as 
""permit in review"". It should be on your dashboard and inaccessible to 
me. 

Therein lies the problem. It is not on your dashboard (even 
though it says it is) it is statused as ""validate reviews"" and I was 
able to move it to the District Engineer for final signature. Go figure. 

I put your email approval in the comments and it is on its way. 

I didn't expect your forces to respond immediately and I do 
appreciate the effort. I know it creates stress when your priorities are 
changed externally. Again I apologize. I hope this note finds you well. 

Have a great day! :-)

Yes, you emailed me and we talked also about it that Permitting and Billboard modules currently don’t support it but I will be looking into it to see what can be done.

I guess we all knew that this page is not functioning correctly.  We had noticed it earlier in the game, but it was a team decision to hold off from fixing this page thinking that we are going to get this page changed to the new DMO style dashboard.   That decision at that time was completely justified since the current page is so outdated.    That decision also supported the company vision at that time to get DREAMAPS Transportation moved to towards  Off-The-Shelf product.  I believe that in our effort estimation we even have assigned some hours to look at this page – to get fixed or to redesign.  At this point, as long as we can get this page to work and get the chart display the correct information, that is all it should matter.

Bug - Internal Reported,System Error,ALDOT-1024,Authorization Page - Permission issues Permit SubTypes,Closed,Unassigned,6/18/13 11:27,"The ""Division Utility Manager"" should only have access to MB-01, MB-02, MB-03, and SP. The PRM_USER_PERMIT_DASHBOARD table is configured correctly but the code is not taking into account the PERMIT_SUBTYPE_ID 

How to reproduce this issue. 
1. Setup your login account to only have Permitting User Type access to ""Division Utility Manager"" 
2. Setup your work location to have Division 1 - District 2 
2. Logoff and log back in 
3. Go to Permitting module 
4. Search for System ID = 200873 and click Select link on record 
5. Go to Authorization page 
Note: You have access to this but in the PRM_USER_PERMIT_DASHBOARD table you don't have access to this PERMIT_SUBTYPE_ID = 117 ""MB-06' 

Solution: 
When the workflow engine is checking permissions it needs to look for the following. 
1. USER_TYPE_ID 
2. PERMIT_TYPE_ID (So the workflow engine is compatiable with NDOT) 
3. DASHBOARD_ID 
4. PERMIT_SUBTYPE_ID 
5. IS_ACTIVE = '1'
